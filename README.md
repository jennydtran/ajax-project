# COLOR Cookbook

## About the App
COLOR Cookbook is an application for anyone who wants to be able to save colors, color schemes, or create custom color schemes for a project to reference later on.

## Demo
Try the application here: https://jennydtran.github.io/color-cookbook/

## Current Features
1. User can select a color based on HEX, RGB, HSL, or CMYK values.
2. User can select a color by using the color picker wheel.
3. User can select a color by having the app randomly select a color for the user.
5. User can view information about the selected color (information such as the name, HEX, RGB, HSL, or CMYK value of the color). ** Note: Some colors will have overlapping names. With the current API, there are only 2000+ named colors but over 16,000,000 color combinations.
5. User can view different color schemes of the color of their choice. Color schemes include monochrome, monochrome dark/light, analogic, analogic-complement, and quad.
6. User can save the color or color scheme of their choice. This information is saved to the user's local storage.
7. User can view the saved colors and color schemes. If users click on the saved items, they are able to access the data of the color or scheme.
8. User can delete saved colors or schemes from the user's "Colorbook"

## Other Notes
COLOR Cookbook originally started off as a project created when I was at the halfway mark in a 14-week full immersion coding bootcamp. The requirement was to come up with an application and use any APIs in the project. Because the project started out as a vanilla JS project, I decided to leave it as that. It is now a project on the side that I work on for fun to practice coding.

Feel free to reach out to me. I am open to suggestions! I am always open to learn any new and to  improve my skills.
