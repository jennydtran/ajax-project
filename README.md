# COLOR Cookbook

## About the App
COLOR Cookbook is an application for anyone who wants to be able to save colors, color schemes, or create custom color schemes for a project to reference later on.

## Demo
Try the application here: https://jennydtran.github.io/color-cookbook/

## Current Features
1. Users can select a color of choice and useful information about the colored will be displayed (information such as the name, HEX, RGB or HSL value of hte color). Let's just say, what if the user doesn't have a color in mind? The app will display a random color for the user if they choose to select a randomly.
2. Users can view different color schemes of the color of their choice. Color schemes include monochrome, monochrome dark/light, analogic, analogic-complement, and quad.
3. Users can save the color and the color scheme of their choice. This information is saved to the user's local storage.
4. Users can view the saved colors and color schemes.

## Last Updated 02/19/2021
* Currently working on enhancing on the page where user selects a color to obtain color data.
* Refer to the issues page of this project to see what else I want to work on.
* Current bugs: There are many (and I mean MANY) bugs that I am aware of. I am trying currently trying to work out a solution to have certain resources load on the page. For example, color wheel only shows up when window is resized upon first load of the page.

## Other Notes
COLOR Cookbook originally started off as a project created when I was at the halfway mark in a 14-week full immersion coding bootcamp. The requirement was to come up with an application and use any APIs in the project. It is now a project on the side that I work on for fun to practice coding.

Feel free to reach out to me. I am open to suggestions! I am always open to learn any new and to  improve my skills.
